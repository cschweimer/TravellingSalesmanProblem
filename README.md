# Travelling Salesman Problem
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks with solutions for various Travelling Salesman Problems. Solutions are being searched with the branch-and-cut method.

The problems to be solved are initially being created on a 100x100 grid with various number of locations. One or more locations are chosen as the start location and one location is chosen as the destination location.

Notebooks termed "Roundtrip" solve problems with one or more salesmen that return to their start location.

Notebooks termed "Pickup_and_Delivery" solve problems where one or more salesmen pick up something at the locations and deliver it to a destination location (e.g., collecting garbage and delivering it to a landfill).
